	19、可能你恰好钻进我的心里堵住了那片空白，到后来我才发现没有你的生活真难熬。
　　秋日暖阳，心儿却早已冰冻。孤枕难眠，与泪共缱绻。灯熄灯灭，呆滞的双眼顷刻泪千行。无人晓得这千行泪包含了几许深入骨髓的痛苦。落叶是离别的味道，当离别变成永久，肉痛的将不但是流年!心碎一旦到过极限，用几许光阴都愈合不全。
I've heard that before marriage came from the next door, the village next door or the development of the campus development.
At that time, I see the other side is a deer jumped up in my heart.
At that time, we don't have the thick makeup, everyone only look at each other.
Such as the road to the south.
Because through a residential area is very remote, motor vehicles and the least, the most humble so crossroads.
But five or six meters wide road, by selling fruit, malatang traders across the tricycle, waiting for the live will give half of off of migrant workers.
The other half, often a stench coming from, also lost the residual poured out from the roadside restaurant food leftovers.
In such an unseemly, hard to avoid is not be sidelined.
That foreign truck over long distances, naturally give ignored this crossroads, large and clumsily across the road, such as driver wolfed down a bowl of noodles, or in the dark night in the monthly wind bubble with dripping wet of urine.
